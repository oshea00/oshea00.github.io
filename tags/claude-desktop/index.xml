      <title>Vibecoding an Agentic Coder - Part 2</title>

In this segment, I&amp;rsquo;ll generate many candidate applications using my experimental framework, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/oshea00/codeagents&#34;&gt;CodeAgents&lt;/a&gt;, choosing from a set of models: GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7, and GPT-4o. Then, I&amp;rsquo;ll compare and contrast the solutions. Along the way, I&amp;rsquo;ll present some ideas and tips on improving AI-generated code in ways that generally translate to other tools and frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t easy to score how good an AI-coded solution is. Of the possible metrics, code complexity might not be as meaningful as long as the AI understands the code, as would &amp;ldquo;maintainability,&amp;rdquo; as that&amp;rsquo;s based on human limitations; the AI can refactor on the fly. Test coverage is a good metric as it measures how well the AI-generated test suite covers the code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;ve tried Cursor, Replit, Lovable, and Bolt with varying degrees of success and found recurring themes in the use of these tools that require &amp;ldquo;vibing&amp;rdquo; until you arrive at a finished, hopefully working, result. Whether the result is good can sometimes be in the eye of the beholder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also become fascinated by how these tools will change the way programmers think about code and its organization — how many rules will be thrown completely out the window and how, oddly, the new rules will harken back to the early days of programming before Google and the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Experimenting with Agentic AI Tooling: My Journey Through the Cutting Edge</title>
      <link>https://oshea00.github.io/posts/agentic-ai-tooling-pains/</link>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I fired up an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server plugin, &amp;ldquo;Agent,&amp;rdquo; I was excited to see it registered in Claude Desktop but immediately annoyed by the errors that popped up. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect a smooth experience in my encounter with the future of Agentic AI, but I found many configuration tweaks, clunky debugging tools, and broken dependencies along the way. It was a stark reminder that we&amp;rsquo;re in the early days, and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of ground to cover before Agents become seamless collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
