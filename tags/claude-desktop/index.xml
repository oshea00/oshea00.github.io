      <title>Vibecoding an Agentic Coder - Part 1</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;ve tried Cursor, Replit, Lovable, and Bolt with varying degrees of success and found recurring themes in the use of these tools that require &amp;ldquo;vibing&amp;rdquo; until you arrive at a finished, hopefully working, result. Whether the result is good can sometimes be in the eye of the beholder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also become fascinated by how these tools will change the way programmers think about code and its organization — how many rules will be thrown completely out the window and how, oddly, the new rules will harken back to the early days of programming before Google and the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Experimenting with Agentic AI Tooling: My Journey Through the Cutting Edge</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I fired up an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server plugin, &amp;ldquo;Agent,&amp;rdquo; I was excited to see it registered in Claude Desktop but immediately annoyed by the errors that popped up. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect a smooth experience in my encounter with the future of Agentic AI, but I found many configuration tweaks, clunky debugging tools, and broken dependencies along the way. It was a stark reminder that we&amp;rsquo;re in the early days, and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of ground to cover before Agents become seamless collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
