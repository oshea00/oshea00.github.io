Large foundation models like GPT can classify text according to a well-crafted prompt instruction, and it&amp;rsquo;s remarkable how well they can do this, considering there has been no explicit training with labeled datasets. This has traditionally been done using machine learning models and logistic regression techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with generative model classification, we lose the &amp;lsquo;confidence level&amp;rsquo; or the probability score of the prediction available in logistic regression. Traditional models like logistic regression provide a probability score for each class, indicating the model&amp;rsquo;s confidence level in its predictions. This confidence score is not just valuable; it&amp;rsquo;s essential for decision-making, as it helps users gauge how confident the model is about its classifications. While generative model responses may align well with the intended classification, we don&amp;rsquo;t directly get an explicit probability for each class. This can be a limitation, particularly in high-stakes applications where knowing the model&amp;rsquo;s confidence level is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
